# ASSESSMENT 1: Tech Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview. If you don't know the answer a good tip is to answer a simpler version of the question.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

INSTRUCTOR EXAMPLE: What is a conditional statement?

2. Which JavaScript operators will return a Boolean value?

Padge

Your answer: The === will return a boolean value. A boolean is a true or false statement. We also have the || which is the OR operator.  Then we have the && which is the AND operator.

Researched answer: I have found that there are multiple operators that will return a boolean operator. We have the comparison operators which are `==`, `===`, `!=`, `!==`, `<`, `<=`, `>`, and `>=`. Then we have the logical operators which are the logical AND operator `&&`, the logical OR `||` and we have the logical NOT `!`. The last batch of operators we have that return a boolean will be the conditional operators `? :`.



3. What is the difference between an array's index and its value?

Jacob
Your answer: Every element of every javascript array has an index. These indexes start at 0 and increment by 1 as elements are added to the array. These elements are the value. Arrays can hold as values; any primitive data type, other arrays, objects, and more.

Researched answer: You can also have mixed type arrays. Meaning you can even have array values of more than one data type at a time. However the indexes will always be numbers starting from 0, incrementing by 1.


4. Compare and contrast arrays and strings. Please include ways in which they are the same and ways in which they are different.

Ricky

Your answer: arrays and strings can both be manipulated by similar built-in methods. A string is a collection of characters, while an array holds a fixed collection of elements with various data types.

Researched answer: The key difference between Array and String is that an Array is a data structure that holds a collection of elements having the same data types, while a String is a collection of characters.

5. Give a brief description of proper pair programming techniques. What are the roles of each person?

Brandon

Your answer: In pair programming both parties should be open minded to each others input. Do not discourage each others inputs and encourage curiosity for ideas. Always be willingly to try new ideas from either party. The roles of pair programming are a Driver and Navigator. The driver types the code while the navigator focuses on the goal of what is being programmed. Also, overlooks ideas and helps the driver by telling him or her what to type or to fix.

Researched answer: For pair programming have two sets of eyes would make it easier to catch mistakes, both have different knowledge and strengths which can lead to a better situation, both hold each other accountable for temptation of taking shortcuts, and verbal communication can help both parties understanding of prgramming. In addition, the roles of a driver is the individual with his or her hands on the keyboard. He or she is responsible for inputting the infromation while following the directions of the navigator. The navigator observes the code for errors, listens to verbal output from the driver, suggests advice, and thinks of the bigger picture of the code. Both should switch roles 10-25 mins.
